                        <p>Images that are produced by cameras capture people inaccurately. A professional camera produces images algorithmically, presenting a microscopic view far beyond what we are capable of seeing with our own eyes.</p>

                        <p>To leave photographs completely unretouched would only result in this mathematically produced scientific perspective, so instead we advocate for images to be retouched to be closer to how we truly see without taking the artform itself out of photography.</p>

                        <p>This results in the following set of core ethical guidelines that we follow in our practice:</p>

                        <p class="pt-6 font-bold">1. Skin</p>
                        <p>Acne is temporary, and thus is retouched out. Scars are permanent but are also highly personal, and so they are removed only if requested. Micro-fluctuations in skin tone are extremely difficult to see with the human eye, and are softened.</p>
                        
                        <p class="pt-6 font-bold">2. Lighting</p>
                        <p>Dodging and burning is a technique that smooths the gradations of light on the face. It is used for a myriad of reasons, but many other photographer’s practices use this technique to make significant modifications to the general shape of someone’s face. We limit our use dodging and burning only to shape and smooth light itself–not people.</p>
                        
                        <p class="pt-6 font-bold">3. Liquify</p>
                        <p>This is the most commonly known and abused retouching technique. The liquify tool is an extremely destructive tool, and has been used to entirely reshape bodies, dismantle bone structure, and resize any and all parts of the body (even eyes, lips, etc). We do not use this tool.</p>
                        
                        <p class="pt-6 font-bold">4. Color Toning</p>
                        <p>Beautiful color toning can create striking images and for many photographers, color toning becomes a part of their signature. We use color toning freely to make scenes and worlds feel more vibrant, and to add unique character and story telling.</p>
